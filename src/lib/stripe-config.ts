/**
 * The client/server-safe Stripe config module (session-22, PAY-STRIPE-1).
 *
 * ZERO runtime imports (no node:crypto, no server-only modules) — this file
 * is safe to bundle into CLIENT components and the Edge-runtime proxy. The
 * hashing/payment seams that DO need node:crypto live in
 * `src/lib/stripe-payment.ts` (server-only), which re-exports these for
 * convenience.
 *
 * The sentinel rule (L16/R8-1 from the reference skill): the SERVER
 * (STRIPE_SECRET_KEY) and CLIENT (publishable key) "configured" checks
 * share one truth table so they can never disagree — a client that thinks
 * Stripe is on while the server doesn't (or vice-versa) renders a broken
 * checkout. The "set-me" placeholder convention from the reference skill
 * is honored: placeholder values are NOT configuration.
