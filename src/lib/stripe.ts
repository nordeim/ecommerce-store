 * The lazy server Stripe client (session-22, PAY-STRIPE-1).
 *
 * Config resolution lives in `src/lib/stripe-payment.ts` (the pure seam —
 * unit-pinned; the sentinel mirror keeps server and client in agreement).
 * This module owns the ONLY import of the SDK in server code, initializes
 * it lazily (the unconfigured default never constructs a client — the app
 * boots with zero Stripe dependencies in flight), and pins the integration
 * constants:
 * - API version: the SDK's pinned default (the account's version governs;
 *   pinning the literal here would drift with upgrades — the SDK types are
 *   the contract).
 * - App-name telemetry: identifies the integration in the Stripe dashboard.
 * - Webhook tolerance: 300s (the reference skill's pin — balances clock
 *   skew vs replay).
